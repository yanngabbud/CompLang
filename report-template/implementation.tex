\subsection{Theoretical Background}
As my extension do not use theoretical concept this section is empty.  

\subsection{Implementation Details}
Describe all non-obvious tricks you used. Tell us what you thought was hard and
why. If it took you time to figure out the solution to a problem, it probably
means it wasn't easy and you should definitely describe the solution in details
here. If you used what you think is a cool algorithm for some problem, tell us.
Do not however spend time describing trivial things (we what a tree traversal
is, for instance). 

After reading this section, we should be convinced that you knew what you were
doing when you wrote your extension, and that you put some extra consideration
for the harder parts.
